    <div class="text-left ps-5 pe-5 fs-5">
      <p>Basecamp has had one foot in the cloud for well over a decade, and HEY has been running there exclusively since
        it was launched two years ago. We've run extensively in both Amazon's cloud and Google's cloud. We've run on
        bare virtual machines, we've run on Kubernetes. We've seen all the cloud has to offer, and tried most of it.
        It's finally time to conclude: Renting computers is (mostly) a bad deal for medium-sized companies like ours
        with stable growth. The savings promised in reduced complexity never materialized. So we're making our plans to
        leave.</p>
